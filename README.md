# ✨ Meditator's Journal

**Meditator's Journal** is an application designed to support both spiritual practice and daily work. The app helps practitioners track progress in their professional tasks as well as meditation sessions, recording levels of awareness through "Mindfulness" counts, and visualizing mental states via real-time charts and graphs.

## ✨ Core Concepts

To use the app effectively, you should understand the following indicators:

* **Mindfulness (Sati):** A unit for measuring awareness. Every time you recognize your breath or mental state and touch the screen, one "Mindfulness" point is recorded.
* **Mindful State:** A state where the frequency of recording (Sati) remains stable and regular.
* **Unmindful:** A state where the mind is distracted or drowsy, resulting in few or no recordings over a period of time.
* **Diligence Streak:** The number of consecutive days you have maintained your practice.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Diverse Goal Management

* **Two main types of goals:**
* **ॐ Meditation:** Tracks meditation duration and counts mindfulness ("Sati") recognitions. The interface features a breathing circle to support focus.
* **⚡ Work (Standard):** A traditional countdown timer used for work, study (similar to Pomodoro), or other habits.


* **Customization:** Set daily goals (minutes), target completion time, representative colors, and management categories.

### 2. Interactive Timer & Recording

* **Meditation Mode:**
* Visual "breathing" effect (expand/contract) helps regulate breathing rhythm.
* **Tap-to-Track:** Touch the screen (or click) every time you acknowledge your focus returning to the breath. These counts accumulate as Mindfulness (Sati) points.

* **Focus Mode:** A countdown timer with a visual progress bar.
* **Manual Entry:** Forgot to start the timer? You can manually log a session or edit previous records.

### 3. Statistics & Data Analysis

* **Dashboard:** View today's progress relative to your set goals.
* **Practice Calendar:** A grid heatmap showing daily practice intensity. Darker colors represent longer practice durations.
* **Visual Charts:**
* **Session Graph:** Review mindfulness levels *within a specific session* (line chart).
* **Weekly/Monthly Statistics:** Compare performance over real-time intervals.
* **Distribution:** A pie chart showing the percentage of time or mindfulness spent on different goals.



### 4. Privacy & Data Security

* **Fully Offline:** 100% of data is stored directly in your browser. No data is sent to any server.
* **Backup & Restore:** Easily export data to a `.json` file for safekeeping or to transfer to another device.
