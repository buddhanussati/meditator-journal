# meditator-journal
Meditator's Journal is an application designed to support both spiritual practice and daily work. The app helps practitioners track progress in their professional tasks as well as meditation sessions, recording levels of awareness through "Mindfulness" counts, and visualizing mental states via real-time charts and graphs.
